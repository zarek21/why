Thank you for downloading this package!

It is compatible with The Built-in Render Pipeline by default. For compatibility with URP, please, import the URP Assets unitypackage, located in the URP Assets folder. 


In order to run the demoscene with proper settings you might need to follow next steps:

- Go to Edit > Project Settings > Graphics. In the Scriptable Render Pipeline Settings field assign "Lowpoly Modular Town URP Asset".

- Go to Edit > Project Settings > Player > Other Settings > Rendering > Color Space and change the value from Gamma to Linear.
